Realized we could avoid creating shapes of innappropriate length, if we made sure that we couldn't create a line of innappropriate length. 
When testing for valid triangles, turns out you can either test for lengths of edges, 
or you can test if the edges have the same slope. If any of the edges on a triangle have the same slope, 
then they are on the same line and not a triangle! Pretty interesting stuff.
I spent some time trying to create an ellipse and circle as inheriting from each other but it proved to be 
difficult. I then tried to move on to creating a square and rectangle hierarchy because of their relationship 
in geometry. A square "is a" special case of a rectangle. After some research I realized this is a flawed assumption, 
that it would carry over into my representation.http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/SquareRectangle.aspx
